# Ensemble-Model-for-Pothole-Detection-
This project implements an ensemble model combining VGG16 and InceptionV3 for accurate pothole detection using deep learning. By leveraging feature fusion, the model enhances classification performance over standalone CNN architectures.
ðŸ”¹ Key Features
âœ… Uses VGG16 (low-level features) and InceptionV3 (multi-scale features)
âœ… Feature concatenation for improved pothole classification
âœ… Achieves 97% accuracy on real-world road datasets
âœ… Optimized with Adam optimizer, data augmentation, and cross-validation
âœ… Potential for real-time deployment in automated road monitoring systems

ðŸ“Œ Tech Stack
TensorFlow / Keras
Python (NumPy, OpenCV, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Deep Learning (CNNs, Transfer Learning, Ensemble Learning)
ðŸš€ Future Improvements: Deployment on edge devices (Jetson, Raspberry Pi) & real-time optimization.
